<!--I learned that there are six heading tags that can be used to make content appear as a heading. <h1> tags are the larget heading, while <h2>,<h3>,<h4>,<h5>, and <h6> tags are subheading tags that are increasingly smaller in order (i.e. <h6> is the smallest subheading). In the example above, line 2 is the largest header, while line 7 is one of the smallest headers.
