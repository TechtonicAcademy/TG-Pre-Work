<body>
    
  <h1>Hello World</h1>

  <div>
    
    <p>
        
      This paragraph is a child of the div element and a grandchild of the body element
        
    </p>

  </div> 
    
</body>

<!--I learned about HTMl hierarchy, and this example shows mulitple levels of nesting. The <body> is the parent. The <h1> is the child of the <body>. The <div> is the child of the body. The <p> is the child of the <div> and the grandchild of the <body>. These family-tree or hierarchical relationships come in handy when applying styling or functional elements with CSS or Javascript because they help keep an organized structure.
